## Hi there 👋

# Ritunjay Murali

Hi, I’m Ritunjay. I’m a software engineer building enterprise AI applications for financial services.

I currently work at Intellect Design Arena, where I build full-stack AI systems on the Purple Fabric platform, ranging from LLM pipelines and multi-agent workflows to databases and backend services. Recent work includes compliance automation, wealth management tools, and lending workflows.

My background spans full-stack development, distributed systems, and machine learning. I’ve built web applications with Vue.js and Node.js, engineered large-scale geospatial data pipelines, developed blockchain security analysis systems, and published IEEE research on disease classification. I’ve also worked on forest classification, automated discovery systems, gaming analytics, and satellite network performance analysis.

What drives me is building reliable software that solves real problems, whether that means optimizing backend performance, designing scalable APIs, automating business workflows, or applying machine learning in production systems. I enjoy working across the stack and learning through hands-on projects.

Open to software engineering roles across backend, full-stack, AI engineering, data engineering, and ML. Always learning and happy to contribute to impactful projects.
