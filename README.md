## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Ritunjay Murali

Engineer with a soft spot for performance, correctness, and clean experiments. I work across ML and systems: from training/serving setups to the lower-level pieces that make them work.

## What Iâ€™m into (right now)
- Making training & inference runs easier to reproduce (env scripts, small profilers, benchmarks)
- Distributed training & serving ergonomics
- Compilers/kernels when performance actually matters

## Open source (actively exploring)
Iâ€™m currently **evaluating issues and planning first PRs** in:
- PyTorch / JAX (distributed, compile/Inductor/XLA)
- vLLM / model-serving tools
- TVM / compiler tooling
- AWS Neuron samples/SDK (Trainium/Inferentia)

*(Iâ€™ll link PRs here as they open/merge.)*

## Projects
- Starlink handover analysis â€” mobility + network performance. [Link](https://github.com/ritunjaym/starlink-satellite-handover-analysis)
- Respiratory sound classification â€” applied ML with a short paper. [Link](https://github.com/ritunjaym/respiratory-sound-classification-ai)
